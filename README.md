# ChatNexus
This a a condcadination of two of my other projects [chatbot-front](https://github.com/XavierElChantiry/chatbot-front) and [chatbot-back](https://github.com/XavierElChantiry/chatbot-back)

This readme is currently a work in progress

This is made up of a fron end and back end, each of which can work on their own, allowing the fron to be hooked into any chat api andd the front to act as a backend api for any project that may need it.
